    The level contains all physics objects and the main game loop.
    The content of each level is defined in level_defs.lua.
    The available objects to build the level are defined in game_element_defs.lua
    The minimum required objects are a projectile cage, projectiles and enemies.
    The player must drag and release the active projectile to launch it and to kill the enemies.
    Obstacles are used as defensive structures to protect the enemies from the projectiles.

collisions:
    Fixtures (from different bodies) collide with each other, not bodies.
    For every intersection between the axis aligned bounding boxes (AABB) of 2 fixtures,
    a contact object is created. It gets destroyed when the intersection stops.
    Contacts are objects created by Box2D to manage collision between two fixtures.
    Contact objects can be obtained with Body:getContacts(), World:getContacts() or
    by using the contact argument in the collision callback functions.
    If a fixture has children (e.g. a line segment of a chain shape), then a contact exists for each relevant child.
    To check if the fixtures are overlapping use Contact:isTouching().
    The contact also contains the 2 colliding fixtures, collision point(s), collision normal (unit) vector, ...
    There can be 0, 1 or 2 collision points (also called manifold). When resolving a collision, a normal impulse
    is applied for each fixture at the collision point(s) along the normal vector to push them apart.
    The collision point(s) are usually not exactly on the fixture surface.
    The normal vector points along the axis of the shortest separation (shortest distance to resolve overlap).

collision callback functions: beginContact, endContact, preSolve, postSolve
    Called inside World:update() when 2 fixtures are overlapping.
    Bodies must not be destroyed inside the world update function (e.g. in the collision callbacks).
    If a fixture has children, they will be called for each relevant child.
    The colliding fixtures and the contact object are passed as arguments,
    but the fixtures in the arguments as well as in the contact object don't have any particular ordering.
    Fixture user data has to be used to identify what collided.
    beginContact is called in the first frame of the overlap.
    After that, preSolve and postSolve are called every frame while the fixtures are overlapping.
    When 2 fixtures are stacked together, preSolve and postSolve will only stop to get called when the fixtures go to sleep.
    endContact is called when the fixtures are no longer overlapping.
    postSolve:
        The normal- and tangent impulse amounts for every collision point are passed as function arguments.
        The impulses are applied along the normal- and tangent vector.
        The tangent vector is orthogonal to the normal vector.
        The normal impulse is influenced by the restitution.
        The tangent impulse is applied to simulate friction between the two colliding fixtures.
    preSolve is called before the collision response is calculated and can be used to modify the contact object.
    Friction, Restitution and if the contact is enabled can be set.

bullet bodies:
    A body can be set to a bullet status with Body:setBullet(true)
    Bullet bodies will check collisions by using continuous collision detection (CCD), instead of only checking
    intersections when the world is updated. This prevents the body from 'tunneling' through fixtures
    from one time step to another when its velocity is high. The collision points will be the exact position
    of the collision. Bullet Bodies will require more CPU time however.

joints:
    A joint connects two bodies together. The joined bodies don't collide by default.
    There are several joint types that all have their own constructor.
    A revolute joint uses one anchor point for each of the 2 bodies in world coordinates, to join them.
    Both bodies are allowed to rotate about that point.
    If the bodies are not at the position that they will be joined in, the joint constraint will take effect
    after creating the joint and the bodies will move to their anchor point by applying the appropriate forces.
    Some joints (like the revolute joint) can be set as a motor with a controllable torque
    (or force for joints that allow the body to slide along an axis).
    Some joints can be given limits, to constrain how far they can rotate or slide.

bounding box querying:
    World:queryBoundingBox(topLeftX, topLeftY, bottomRightX, bottomRightY, callback)
    check if a fixture's AABB intersects with the query AABB defined by the 2 coordinates.
    For every found fixture, the registered callback function is called with the fixture as input parameter.
    If the callback returns true, it will continue to get called for every found fixture.
    If the callback returns false, it will not get called any more for the remaining fixtures.

ray casting:
    A ray can be cast against a Fixture with Fixture:rayCast(). see: https://love2d.org/wiki/Fixture:rayCast
    To invoke a callback function for every fixture that a ray intersects with, use World:rayCast().
    see: https://love2d.org/wiki/World:rayCast
